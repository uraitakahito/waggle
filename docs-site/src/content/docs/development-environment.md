title: Development environment
description: Prerequisites, daily commands, running without Compose, and troubleshooting.
---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** (the version in `.nvmrc`). `nvm use` if you have nvm.
- **pnpm 11** — the version pinned by `packageManager`. `corepack enable` installs it.
- **[Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container)** and
  **container-compose** (both via Homebrew) — required for the stack, not for
  host-only development. macOS only.
- **`curl`** and **`git`** on PATH.
- A **Postgres** at `DATABASE_URL`. The Compose stack brings one up.
- For an end-to-end capture, a **BrowserHive** and the Windmill flow that drives
  it. waggle no longer holds a BrowserHive address — it dispatches to
  `WAGGLE_CRAWL_WEBHOOK_URL` instead, and the flow lives in
  [capture-scheduler](https://github.com/uraitakahito/capture-scheduler). The stack still builds
  BrowserHive because the flow needs one; see
  [Upgrading BrowserHive](/waggle/upgrading-browserhive/) for the pinned version.

## First-time setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<you>/waggle.git
cd waggle
nvm use
pnpm install
sudo container system dns create waggle   # once per machine
./setup.sh          # submodules + .env
pnpm run check       # typecheck + lint + format:check + env + tests
```

`setup.sh` is mandatory before any `container-compose` invocation: it
initialises the `.upstream/browserhive` submodule that every build context
points at, and refuses to continue if the `waggle` DNS domain is missing.

### Environment variables

The code reads **35** of them, through three different mechanisms:
`required()`/`optional()` in `src/config/`, commander's `.env()` (so they also
show up in `--help`), and plain `process.env[…]` — the last of which reaches
into `scripts/` too. Seven are mandatory.

`.env.example` is the single list. `setup.sh` copies it to `.env` and
copies it verbatim, changing no values; nothing else generates
`.env`, because a second list drifts from the first. The two OpenFGA ids stay
empty until `pnpm run fga:deploy` prints them — see
[Archive ledger](/waggle/archive-ledger/#setup).

`scripts/check-env.mjs` (part of `pnpm run check`, and a step of its own in CI)
compares the names the code reads against the names `.env.example` declares, in
both directions. A stale template is worse than no template: it gets trusted,
so when something is missing there is nothing left to suspect.

### An empty value is not the same as no value

`FOO=` in a `.env` file sets `FOO` to the empty string; omitting the line leaves
it unset. Those are different states, and POSIX gives them different syntax —
`${FOO:-default}` falls back on either, `${FOO-default}` only on unset.

This repo picks the first meaning everywhere: **empty means absent**. Read env
through `optional()` (or `need()`), never through `process.env[…] ?? default`,
which is the second meaning and would keep the empty string.

Because a variable that is _set to empty_ is almost always a typo rather than an
intent, the startup guard in `src/config/env.ts` **refuses to run** and names it,
rather than quietly falling back. That is worth doing: an empty value used to be
strictly worse than a missing one — `DATABASE_URL=` passed commander's mandatory
check, the API started, `/healthz` answered 200, and the first query failed with
a SASL error that never mentioned `DATABASE_URL`.

So `.env.example` has only two kinds of line:

```sh
NAME=value     # pass a value
#NAME=value    # show the default; uncomment and edit to use it
```

A bare `NAME=` is allowed **only for the seven required variables**, whose
emptiness is reported as "missing" by `collectEnv`. `check-env.mjs` enforces
that rule too.

## Daily commands

| Command                                   | What it does                                                        |

| `pnpm run proto:generate`                 | Regenerate `src/rpc/generated/` from the vendored `.proto` (buf).   |
| `pnpm run proto:check`                    | Generate, then `git diff --exit-code` (CI drift gate).              |
| `pnpm run proto:sync`                     | Re-copy the `.proto` from the pinned submodule.                     |
| `pnpm run site:dev` / `site:build`        | This documentation site.                                            |
| `pnpm run site:check`                     | Build the site and verify its references.                           |

## Working against the stack

```sh
pnpm run stack:up
# grpcurl reads the vendored contract; GetStatus is the readiness probe.
until grpcurl -plaintext -import-path proto -proto browserhive/v1/capture.proto \
  localhost:50051 browserhive.v1.CaptureService/GetStatus >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 1; done
```

**There is no dev container.** container-compose has exactly four subcommands —
`up`, `down`, `build`, `version` — so there is no `exec` to drop into. It does
not need one: the platform DNS resolves `<service>.waggle` from the host as well
as between containers, so waggle runs on the host against the containerised
stack. `setup.sh` writes the connection string into `.env`:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://waggle:waggle@postgres.waggle:5432/waggle
```

There is no BrowserHive address here any more. The one gRPC endpoint the stack
publishes, `localhost:50051`, is for grpcurl and for the flow — not for waggle.

The `pnpm run` scripts read that `.env` themselves
(`node --env-file-if-exists=.env`) — no shell `export` needed. **Variables
already in the environment win**, so `DATABASE_URL=... pnpm run db:migrate`
points one run at a different database. Invoking `node dist/...` directly does
not load it; pass what you need yourself there.

Postgres is also published on `127.0.0.1:5432`, so `localhost` works too.

Coming from Docker Compose, the everyday commands map like this:

| Docker Compose                    | Apple Container                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `docker compose up -d --build`    | `container-compose up -d -b`         |
| `docker compose down`             | `container-compose down`             |
| `docker compose ps`               | `container ls`                       |
| `docker compose logs browserhive` | `container logs browserhive.waggle`  |
| `docker compose exec <svc> sh`    | `container exec -it <svc>.waggle sh` |
| `docker compose run --rm <svc> …` | `container run --rm <image> …`       |

The Chromium workers are **headless**. To watch one render, open
`chrome://inspect` in a local Chrome, add `localhost:9222` and `localhost:9223`
under _Configure…_, and inspect the target.

## Production smoke test

```sh
./scripts/prod-smoke.sh
```

It brings the stack up, polls `GetStatus` until BrowserHive answers, builds
`waggle:latest`, then runs migrate → seed → the API with `container run --rm`,
asks the API for `/healthz`, tears the stack down through an `EXIT` trap, and
forwards the exit code as its own.

**It no longer captures anything.** waggle does not speak gRPC to BrowserHive,
so what this script proves is that the image boots: migrations apply, the seed
lands, the API answers. The capture path is covered end to end by capture-scheduler's
`pnpm run test:e2e`, which needs Windmill as well.

The one-shot jobs are plain `container run` calls because container-compose has
no `run` subcommand. That also retires the old
`--profile run --exit-code-from waggle` workaround: the Docker Compose behaviour
it worked around — aborting the whole stack on the migrator's legitimate exit 0
— has no equivalent here.

## Working against an external Postgres

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@db.host:5432/waggle \
  pnpm run db:migrate

DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@db.host:5432/waggle \
WAGGLE_CRAWL_WEBHOOK_URL=https://windmill.example/api/w/…/jobs/run/f/f/crawl \
WAGGLE_CRAWL_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=… \
  pnpm run api
```

For Postgres TLS, encode the parameters in `DATABASE_URL` (e.g.
`?sslmode=require`).

**BrowserHive's TLS is not configured here any more.** The flow holds that
channel, so its CA lives on the Windmill side — the variable
`u/admin/browserhive_tls_ca`, where an empty string means plaintext.

## Setting up an identity locally

There is one entry point for identity — the API — and it **denies everyone by
default.**

| Path                 | Default | Dev header              | JWT                  |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| API (`/api`, picker) | deny    | `WAGGLE_DEV_IDENTITY=1` | `WAGGLE_OIDC_ISSUER` |

There used to be a second row for the CLI, reading `WAGGLE_DEV_SUBJECT` and
`WAGGLE_OIDC_TOKEN` from the environment. Both went with it, and are no longer
declared in `.env.example` — **claiming a subject is the caller's job now.**

**The JWT path wins over the dev header.** When both are set, an environment must not
fall back to the weaker one, where anyone who reaches the port can be anyone.

### The dev issuer

Setting `WAGGLE_OIDC_ISSUER` makes the API run **the same verification code
production will run** — signature, `iss` / `aud`, expiry, and the JWKS fetch. Until a
real IdP is chosen, the bundled issuer stands in for one.

```bash
pnpm run oidc:issuer                                   # listens on :9099
export WAGGLE_OIDC_ISSUER=http://127.0.0.1:9099
TOKEN=$(pnpm run oidc:token --subject alice --org acme)
curl -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:7070/api/crawls
```

The token does not belong in `.env` — the API is what reads it, and the caller
is what puts it in the `Authorization` header.

Changing `--subject` lets you produce **both "a person submitted this" and "a service
submitted this"**. In the second case the OpenFGA owner tuple becomes
`user:<service>`, and no person can delete the archive — you can walk into that
authorization gap here, before real authentication exists.

:::caution[Development only]
`POST /token` mints a token for anyone who asks, which is why it warns on startup. The
key lives only inside the issuer process and **is regenerated on every start** — restart it
and previously minted tokens stop verifying. That is key rotation, reproduced.
:::

### Moving to a real IdP

Only the values of `WAGGLE_OIDC_ISSUER` and `WAGGLE_OIDC_AUDIENCE` change.
`jwtIdentityResolver` does not change at all.

Note that **the JWKS-over-HTTP path cannot be covered by unit tests**. Swapping
`createRemoteJWKSet` for a local key leaves the suite green, so walking through this
section is what guards it instead.

The spelling of the organizations claim differs per IdP (`groups` / `roles` / something
custom). There is one place to change: `ORGANIZATIONS_CLAIM` in `src/config/identity.ts`,
which the API reads through `identityFromClaims`.

## Troubleshooting

- **A container will not come up** — `container ls` shows what is running and
  `container logs <svc>.waggle` shows why. For Chromium,
  `curl http://localhost:9222/json/version` tells you whether CDP is answering.
- **Names do not resolve** — check that `container system dns ls` lists
  `waggle`, and that no service in `docker-compose.yml` has a `container_name:`
  key (it suppresses the DNS naming).
- **BrowserHive exits at boot** — its startup `HeadBucket` is fatal. Check that
  `WAIT_FOR_S3` is set on the service and that SeaweedFS logged
  `Bucket browserhive ready.`
- **`/api/crawls` answers 404 to everyone** — either the caller lacks
  `can_submit`, or the route was never registered because
  `WAGGLE_CRAWL_WEBHOOK_URL` is unset. The startup log says which
  (`… is not set — /api/crawls is not served`).
- **The docs build cannot read the BrowserHive pin** — run
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

### Crawling something you control

The stack ships a fixture origin — [meadow](https://github.com/uraitakahito/meadow) —
behind a profile, so a crawl can be exercised without pointing it at a stranger's
site:

```sh
pnpm run stack:up --profile meadow
```

It publishes no port; `meadow.waggle:8080` resolves from containers and from the
host alike. `/links/hub` is the seed to use — every `/links/*` page is that page
with exactly one thing changed, which is what lets a crawler applying the wrong
rule be told apart from one that is simply broken.

meadow also keeps a request log, and that is the point of using it:

```sh
curl -s http://meadow.waggle:8080/__request-counts
```

`crawl_pages` says what waggle _recorded_; the log says what the fixture was
_actually asked for_. "The crawler honoured robots" is a claim only the second one
can settle — a page missing from the ledger might never have been fetched, or might
have been fetched and dropped.

meadow is vendored directly at `.upstream/meadow` rather than through
`.upstream/browserhive`, which carries its own much older copy. The two pins move
for different reasons and neither should wait on the other.

### Signing an archive

Signing needs two things at once: `capping` and `tsa` running, and BrowserHive
knowing where to ask. **One line turns on both.**

```sh
# .env
WAGGLE_CAPTURE_SIGNING=1
```

`pnpm run stack:up` reads that line and adds `--profile signing` (which starts
`capping` and `tsa`) together with `--env-file signing.env` (which tells
BrowserHive where to ask). It prints what it added, so the reason `capping` is
running is never a mystery.

**There is no way to pass one without the other**, and that is the point. The
settings used to live in three places that did not know about each other — the
`.env` flag, the profile, and four `BROWSERHIVE_SIGNING_*` entries hardcoded into
`docker-compose.yml`. Turning signing on without starting the profile made every
capture fail with `ENOTFOUND capping.waggle`, which reads like a DNS fault and is
not one: the name is correct, the service simply was not running.

The signing settings cannot go back into `docker-compose.yml`, not even blanked
out. This is [the empty-value trap](#an-empty-value-is-not-the-same-as-no-value)
again, one level out: BrowserHive branches on `signing.url === undefined`, but
commander decides with `envVar in process.env`, so `- BROWSERHIVE_SIGNING_URL=`
counts as _set_. The result is `fetch("")` and `TypeError: Failed to parse URL
from ` — an error that never names the variable, exactly like the `DATABASE_URL=`
story above. With the entry genuinely absent, BrowserHive says `no signing
service is configured on this server`.

Signing is fail-closed: a capture that asked for a signature and could not get
one fails rather than producing an unsigned archive.

## Repo conventions

- Source under `src/`, tests under `test/`, one concern per module.
- `src/rpc/generated/` is generated and committed; never edit it by hand.
- Prettier and ESLint are authoritative — run `pnpm run check` before pushing.
- Documentation lives in `docs-site/`, in English and Japanese. Adding an
  English page without its Japanese counterpart fails `pnpm run site:check`.
