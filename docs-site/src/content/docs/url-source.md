description: The capture_targets table waggle reads, and how to manage it.
---

waggle's entire input is one Postgres table. **waggle never inserts into it** —
populating `capture_targets` is the caller's job, whether that is a manual `INSERT`, an
external pipeline, or the bundled seed.

## The query

A crawl started with `fromTargets` is this, and nothing more:

```sql
SELECT url FROM capture_targets WHERE enabled AND org_id = $1 ORDER BY id ASC [LIMIT $2]
```

`ORDER BY id ASC` means rows are seeded in insertion order, and
`fromTargets.limit` takes the first _n_ — so a smoke test always exercises the
same URLs. The `org_id` filter is what keeps a crawl inside one tenant: a crawl
carries a single organization, so seeding it from another one's rows would leave
attribution unanswerable.

## Schema

```ts file="src/db/migrations/001-create-capture-targets.ts#capture-targets-columns"

```

| Column                      | Notes                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                        | `BIGSERIAL` primary key. Insertion order, preserved by the loader's `ORDER BY`.                                             |
| `url`                       | `CHECK (url <> '' AND url = btrim(url))` — the database rejects empty and untrimmed values, so no caller has to.            |
| `url_hash`                  | Generated `digest(url, 'sha256')` (pgcrypto), stored. Backs the unique index; nothing reads it directly.                    |
| `labels`                    | `TEXT[]`. **Nothing reads them any more** — see below.                                                                      |
| `enabled`                   | The hot path is `WHERE enabled`, covered by the partial index `capture_targets_enabled_id_idx`. Disabled rows cost nothing. |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | `now()` defaults. No auto-update trigger today.                                                                             |

`capture_targets_url_hash_key` is unique, so the same URL cannot be enqueued twice.

## Labels

:::caution[Labels no longer travel]
The column is still here, the seed still fills it, and the ledger still has a
`labels` column of its own — but **the crawl path selects `url` alone** and
submits with an empty label list. So labels reach neither BrowserHive nor the
artifact filenames today. Treat the column as annotation on the target row, not
as something that will show up downstream.
:::

They were free-form and ended up in the artifact filename, which made them the
natural place for an external key: BrowserHive escapes anything that would
collide with the filename's structure, so `_`, `.`, `/`, spaces and non-ASCII all
survived the round trip, with the whole artifact name limited to 255 UTF-8 bytes.
The bundled fixture still uses a securities code alongside a company name:

```ts
{ url: "https://www.ana.co.jp/group/", labels: ["9202", "ANAHoldings"] }
```

## Adding URLs

```sql
INSERT INTO capture_targets (url, labels) VALUES
  ('https://example.com/', ARRAY['example']),
  ('https://example.org/', ARRAY['example', 'org'])
ON CONFLICT (url_hash) DO NOTHING;
```

To take a URL out of rotation without losing its history, set `enabled = false`
rather than deleting the row.

## Migrations

Migration files live under `src/db/migrations/<NNN>-<description>.ts` and export
`up(db)` / `down(db)`. The runner is a thin wrapper around Kysely's `Migrator`
with `FileMigrationProvider`; applied IDs are tracked in the `kysely_migration`
table (`kysely_migration_lock` guards concurrent runs), so re-running
`pnpm run db:migrate` is a no-op once current.

```sh
pnpm run db:migrate       # apply
pnpm run db:migrate:down  # revert the last one
```

To add one:

1. Pick the next ordinal, e.g. `002-add-priority.ts`.
2. Implement `up` and `down` with the schema builder, or ``sql`…`.execute(db)``
   for what it does not cover — extensions, generated columns, `CHECK`
   expressions referencing other columns.
3. Round-trip locally: `pnpm run db:migrate && pnpm run db:migrate:down && pnpm run db:migrate`.
   CI runs the same round trip.
4. Commit the migration and the code that depends on it together.

Seeds have the same shape under `src/db/seeds/` but use a separate `kysely_seed`
table, so they can be applied and reverted independently.
