# End-to-end smoke test of the production image against a real stack.
#
# Brings the stack up with container-compose, waits for BrowserHive to answer,
# then runs migrate → seed → the API from the freshly built capture-ledger image, and
# tears everything down through an EXIT trap.
#
# **It no longer captures anything.** capture-ledger does not speak gRPC to BrowserHive
# any more — the Windmill flow submits, and capture-ledger plans and records. What this
# script proves is that the image boots: migrations apply, the seed lands, and
# the API answers. The capture path is covered end to end by capture-scheduler's
# `pnpm run test:e2e`, which needs Windmill as well.
#
# The one-shot jobs are `container run` rather than compose services:
# container-compose has exactly four subcommands (up / down / build / version),
# so there is no `run` to lean on. Calling the runtime directly is also what
# retires the old `--profile run --exit-code-from capture-ledger` workaround — the
# Docker Compose behaviour that made it necessary (aborting the whole stack on
# the migrator's legitimate exit 0) has no equivalent here.
